    <description>A dryad caste with the unique ability to produce new Polux pods and reproduce the Polux tree along with its symbiote, the dryad queen. To do this, three poluxmaker dryads must slowly merge.\n\nIn general, dryads are mammal-like creatures that have a symbiotic relationship with the Gauranlen tree. They reproduce together with their tree, which contains a hidden dryad queen. Dryads can morph into various specialized castes.</description>
